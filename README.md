Here are all the files I used to Klipperize my Ender-3 Neo

"Klipper Communication Options.png" is from a user named “JamesH[E3v2,MercOne.1+,Micron+]” in the Klipper Discord

The schematic graph of the Creality v4.2.2 Board is from: https://klipper.discourse.group/t/creality-board-4-2-2-and-4-2-7-schematics/3104

More files will be added later~
