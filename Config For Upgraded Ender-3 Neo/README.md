The costs to upgrade is actually not high~

Changes to the hardware includes:
- Switched the CR-Touch bed leveling probe to the rigth side of the toolhead
- Added a filament runout sensor
- Installed the Orbiter v2.5 extruder
- Changed model cooling fan from a single 4010 blower fan to two 5015 fans 

Link to the toolhead will be added later
